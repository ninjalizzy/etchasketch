# etchasketch

Choose how big of a grid you want and hover over each box to change its color like an Etch-A-Sketch from days gone by.

Lessons learned/reviewed:
 - DEFERRRR!!!!
 - Should have branched the color picker feature earlier
 - CSS Grid basics
 - Set up a prompt loop for a range of integers while being able to break out on cancel; parseInt practice
 - Chaining DOM manipulations (e.g., get + listener on line 27); tying directly to variable with arrow fn

Possible improvements:
 - Project originally called for random box color instead of user-picked; could try that
 - Let user choose background color of grid
